        Q1. WHY IS MY APP NOT RUNNING?<br>
        Ans. This is possible due to the fact you may not have had the KIVYMD and KIVY packages installed on startup.<br> To rectify this delete and reinstall the application or if you know how to use the pip command, Type<br>
        <h5>
            pip install KIVY <br>
            pip install KIVYMD
        </h5>
        in the terminal<hr>
        Q2. APP IS RUNNING BUT IT WONT LET ME LOGIN?<br>
        Ans. This error is occuring due to the fact you have probably not entered the correct mysql password or you may not have mysql server not installed at all.<br> This may happen if your password is SHA2 protected.<br> Please shift to legacy password to connect seamlessly if this has been your issue. Else simply delete full app and reinstall it
